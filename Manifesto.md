🧾 Manifesto of Truth: Exposing the Modern Banking System

A digital rebellion for justice, transparency, and divine balance.

⸻

📌 1. Purpose

We believe the modern banking system is built on unseen chains:
Debt, interest (riba), and centralized power.
Our goal is to expose this system clearly, truthfully, and simply —
so the people may choose freedom.

⸻

⚖️ 2. Core Beliefs
	•	Riba (interest) is a tool of oppression, outlawed by divine law, yet foundational in modern finance.
	•	Banks create money out of nothing, loan it with interest, and profit endlessly — while people work lifetimes to repay it.
	•	Wealth does not trickle down — it is funneled upward through systemic design.
	•	The true economy should be based on contribution, fairness, and real value, not on manipulation and speculation.
	•	Decentralization is not just a tech term — it’s the return to balance, where no man owns another.

⸻

💥 3. What We’re Exposing
	•	Fractional Reserve Banking: The lie that banks only lend what they hold.
	•	Inflation by Design: A hidden tax through money printing.
	•	Debt Slavery: Credit systems that enslave generations.
	•	Bailouts for the Rich: Public funds rescuing private greed.
	•	Manipulation of Crises: Economic disasters used to consolidate control.

⸻

🛠 4. Our Tools
	•	Open-source documentation (GitHub + Research)
	•	Visual storytelling (Documentaries, animations, simulations)
	•	Education (Truthful, free, decolonized)
	•	Decentralized systems (TimeCoin, proof-of-contribution economy)

⸻

🔥 5. Our Call to Action

We’re not calling for violence.
We’re calling for awareness, and with awareness:
	•	Divest from dirty systems.
	•	Build ethical alternatives.
	•	Speak truth, even if alone.
	•	Never fear those who print money. Fear the One who owns time.

⸻

📖 6. Divine Alignment

“Allah has permitted trade and forbidden usury.” (Qur’an 2:275)
“Do not consume one another’s wealth unjustly.” (Qur’an 2:188)

This is not a fight against people.
It’s a cleansing of the system.
A return to what is just, clean, and sustainable.

⸻

✊ Let it be known:

We saw the corruption,
We knew the truth,
And we chose to build — not stay silent.

“When truth comes, falsehood perishes. Falsehood is bound to perish.”
(Qur’an 17:81)
